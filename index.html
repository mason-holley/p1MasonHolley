    >Microwave User Interface Issues</font>
  </div>
  <p>
  &emsp; While this microwave is not unusable, I have specific complaints about it that bring difficulty. <br>
  <br> &emsp; First, the Popcorn button. In the few microwaves I have used over my life, the popcorn button has been very easy to use. Place the bag of unpopped popcorn in, hit the popcorn button, and receive perfectly cooked popcorn. This is the first microwave in which the popcorn button requires extra input from the user that I have used. Once pressed, the display shows "0.0" and will not start without input from the user. <br> 
  &emsp; Without access to the microwave manual, I had no idea what needed to be inputted. Through trial and error, I eventually found that you should input the weight of the bag. The problem is the numbers do not actually matter. Once I got the popcorn box out and found that each bag weighed 3.2 ounces, I entered 3.2 and received nothing but a harsh beep in response, with the 3.2 being set back to 0.0.I attempted different weights and the only weight that made the microwave start is 3.5. Why bother having the user enter a weight if there is only one valid weight? <br>
  <br>
  &emsp; There are similar problems with the other buttons. What does the Pizza button do? Is it slices of pizza or a whole pizza? If it is slices, why does it once again come up with 0.0 and only work with 1.0 entered? If it were slices, 2.0 should work for 2 slices, right? The potato button only activates at a certain weight as well, 7.0. What if my potato is larger or smaller than 7.0 ounces? Why bother having user input in the first place? <br>
  &emsp; The 'Cook Time' button is redundant. In no situation have I ever needed to press the Cook Time button. If I need to change the time, I can just press the numbers.<br>

  <p align="center">
    1.	Usage of any of the specific buttons <br>
    2.	Disinfecting kitchen items <br>
    3.	Heating non-food items <br>
    4.	Toasting foods <br>

    The microwave hinders some of my most common actions, specifically the making of popcorn. <br> Besides that, the usage of the ADD 30 SEC button works wonders. One button that does exactly what I need. <br> Despite other problems with this microwave, the ADD 30 SEC button is a great tool for ease of use of the microwave.

    >Average Microwave Use Case</font>
  </div>
  <p align="center">
    User has an item they wish to heat up in the microwave. <br>
    User will open the microwave with the door, place the item in, and close the microwave door. <br>
    User will input the desired cook time and optionally, the desired power of the microwave. <br>
    User will hit the start button and wait the set time. <br>
    User will pull the food out of the microwave and close it.  <br>
  </p>

    >Microwave Usability</font>
  </div>

  <p>
    &emsp;The microwave makes it obvious you need to pull open the microwave door with a large handle. The microwave communicates to the user how to use it by labeling all the buttons. It is still not entirely clear what the buttons do, how they work, or what input they take, but a user can still generally guess what each button will attempt to do. 
    <br>&emsp;The microwave provides feedback with loud beeping sounds for every button press. Each time a button is pressed, the clock display changes. There is no haptic feedback, so these two things are the only sign the microwave is functioning before the cooking begins. Upon opening the microwave door, the inner lights turn on; upon closing they turn off again. 
    <br>&emsp;Once the cooking starts, the microwave’s internal lights come on and a low hum begins to radiate from the microwave. The glass plate inside the microwave continuously spins until the cooking has finished.

    >Common Usage Mistakes</font>
  </div>
    
  <p>
    &emsp;As mentioned above, the usage of any of the specialty buttons can only be described as a shot in the dark. There is no clear way to identify how to work any of the specialty buttons once pressed, as nearly all of them demand another input from the user. The valid inputs available can only be ascertained by finding the manual or trial and error testing. 
	<br>&emsp;Other problems can arise from trying to ascertain how much power the microwave is cooking at. While the cook power cycles between 3 options of low, medium, and high, there is no documentation in or on the microwave that tells what numerical value these options are. Because this is an apartment, the microwave did not come with a manual, so the differences in cooking power remain a mystery to me. 
	<br>&emsp;The ‘hold three seconds’ instruction is also unclear to me. Its placement implies that the cancel button must be held for 3 seconds for it to cancel, however just one press of the cancel button will do the job. Does holding the cancel button for 3 seconds lock the microwave? If so, how do you unlock it? Why would you want to lock something in the microwave in the first place? 
	<br>&emsp;Misinputs involving the placement of the clock and timer/setoff buttons are more common than they should be. It is not entirely clear where each button begins and ends. Often, I have attempted to enter a number and either enter more than one number or start adjusting the clock.
	<br>&emsp;Attempting to use the microwave in low light environments is also a struggle. None of the buttons are lit up, and even if the user can locate the included ‘Light’ button darkness it does not offer any significant increase in the visibility of the buttons themselves, as all the light button does is turn on a small light that is on the bottom of the microwave. If the microwave is rested on a surface, the bottom light is nearly completely blocked.
