  <p>
  &emsp; While this microwave is not unusable, I have specific complaints about it that bring difficulty. <br>
  &emsp; First, the Popcorn button. In the few microwaves I have used over my life, the popcorn button has been very easy to use. Place the bag of unpopped popcorn in, hit the popcorn button, and receive perfectly cooked popcorn. This is the first microwave in which the popcorn button requires extra input from the user that I have used. Once pressed, the display shows "0.0" and will not start without input from the user. <br> 
  &emsp; Without access to the microwave manual, I had no idea what needed to be inputted. Through trial and error, I eventually found that you should input the weight of the bag. The problem is the numbers do not actually matter. Once I got the popcorn box out and found that each bag weighed 3.2 ounces, I entered 3.2 and received nothing but a harsh beep in response, with the 3.2 being set back to 0.0.I attempted different weights and the only weight that made the microwave start is 3.5. Why bother having the user enter a weight if there is only one valid weight? <br>
  <br>
  &emsp; There are similar problems with the other buttons. What does the Pizza button do? Is it slices of pizza or a whole pizza? If it is slices, why does it once again come up with 0.0 and only work with 1.0 entered? If it were slices, 2.0 should work for 2 slices, right? The potato button only activates at a certain weight as well, 7.0. What if my potato is larger or smaller than 7.0 ounces? Why bother having user input in the first place? <br>
  &emsp; The 'Cook Time' button is redundant. In no situation have I ever needed to press the Cook Time button. If I need to change the time, I can just press the numbers.<br>
